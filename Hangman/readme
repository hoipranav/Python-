Hello there..!
Welcome to the Hangman Game.!
Let me tell you how this game works
- There's a random hidden chosen word whose number of letters will be known to player/user, they'll have to guess the letters of that word.
- The user/palyer has 7 lives, if the player guesses the right word then that word will be replaced in the blanks list of that word but if the 
  user/player guesses a wrong they lose a life and the hangman starts to draw..!
- Once all the right words are guessed the user wins but if they're not able to guess the word by guessing the letters then eventually the hangman will be drawn 
  completely and they Lose.
